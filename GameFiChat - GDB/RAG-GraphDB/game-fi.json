        "about": "INTRODUCTION \n Axie Infinity Universe \n Axie Infinity is a game universe filled with fascinating creatures, Axies, that players can collect as pets. Players aim to battle, breed, collect, raise, and build kingdoms for their Axies. The universe has a player-owned economy where players can truly own, buy, sell, and trade resources they earn in the game through skilled-gameplay and contributions to the ecosystem. \n There are and will be many varied games experiences for Axies. Many of them will have players compete with each other using complex strategies and tactics to attain top rankings or be rewarded with coveted resources. Others will have them complete quests, defeat bosses, and unlock in-depth storylines. \n There are countless unique Axies that players can collect with varying body parts and appearances. Body parts will unlock abilities for Axies that vary across games, they will have completely different values, benefits, and skills from one game to another. Body parts also have their own unique card art for players to collect. \n Community & Economy \n All art assets and Axie genetic data can be easily accessed by 3rd parties, allowing community developers to build their own tools and experiences in the Axie Infinity universe. While still in early access, Axie is ranked the #1 Ethereum game by daily, weekly, and monthly active users. Players have spent over 1M ETH (3B+ USD) so far to progress in the game. While Axie is a fun game, it's also taken on characteristics of a social network and earning platform due to the strong community and opportunity to truly own resources earned within the games. A key difference between Axie and a traditional game is that Blockchain economic design unlocks the ability to have complex player-owned economies and reward players who are able to reach advanced levels of skill. Players are able to have fun and work towards ambitious goals while simultaneously earning potential resources that will have real monetary value due to an open economic system and demand from other players - \"Play-and-Earn\".Currently, players can gain more resources to advance in the game by taking actions such as:  \n Competing in Battles to win leaderboard prizes as well as Smooth Love Potions (SLP) Breeding Axies to produce new ones with particular Body Part combinations Collecting and speculating on rare Axies such as Mystics and Origins \n Mission \n We're here to create an ecosystem of amazing Axie gaming experiences with community and player-owned economies as foundational pillars.",

        "about": "INTRODUCTION \n Pegaxy is a play-to-earn PVP style horse racing game where players compete for top 3 placement against 14 other racers. Each race has randomised elemental variables which include wind, water, fire, speed and more. Using strategic upgrades, food and skill, players must place in the top 3 to earn the platforms utility token, VIS (Vigorus). \n Within the game, players are able to breed, merge, rent, sell, and of course race their Pega to earn VIS tokens. This system has proven to be a sound long-term economic approach when building an NFT/Blockchain based game as it enables teams to build large guilds, scholarship programs, and even provides solo players the opportunity to earn in game tokens through daily racing. \n The initial sale of 5,000 Founding Pega was held in October 2021, alongside the PGX launch via IDO in November. The first 5,000 Pega were dubbed \"Founding\" Pega as they were the only ones  created by the Pegaxy Development team. Every Pega after #5,000 has been minted (created) through the breeding model inside the game. \n Pegaxy is well respected within the industry for its innovation in trustless rental systems, on chain technology and well weighted economic balance. Many also attribute its popularity to the gameplay, team transparency and community involvement during the development process.",
